## Milestone 1: Functioning Curp system and simple userapp (Nov 8th)
### Milestone 1.1: Functioning Curp system
- Correct (to some extent) implementation of Curp consensus algorithm
- Support failure handler (for all three `NodeRoles`). Leader re-election.
### Milestone 1.2: Simple userapp (on top of Curp system)
- C-esque userapp that writes to some arbitrary offset of a text file (with `lseek` and `write`)
## Milestone X: Fully integrated Curp and TreeDoc
## Milestone X + 1: Functional frontend and snapshot support onto Curp and TreeDoc

# Misc
- Reduce TreeDoc runtime/space overhead
- Linearizability guaranteed
- Dynamic Membership Curp
